# Ball_star_Tree  c++ implementation.
- The data is already in `textfiles/data.txt`.  
- When running the program, it will ask for the name of a song (make sure to write it accurately; if the song name has a comma, omit it).  
- It will ask for the number of the k closest neighbors.  
- The execution times for each step will be displayed in ns and ms.  
- The project includes 2 different KNN methods. The first one makes use of the structure's properties and is based on the algorithm proposed by:  
  Liu, T., Moore, A.W., Gray, A.: *New algorithms for efficient high-dimensional nonparametric classification*. JMLR 7, 1135â€“1158 (2006).  
  The second one follows a more linear search (based on the number of data points) while staying within the structure.  
- The project uses the EIGEN library for PCA computation.
